# Tic-Tac-Toe-with-the-MSP432-LaunchPad

- The purpose of this project is to create a game of Tic Tac Toe with the MSP432 LaunchPad and external hardware. 
- The game lets the user play against the LaunchPad against different modes of difficulty
- The code uses an AI algorithm to let the LaunchPad always choose the best move if that difficulty is chosen
- THe project utilizes timers and ADC peripherals to keep track of time passed when playing and obtaining user input from a slider potentiometer
- Project Video.mp4 describes the implementational details and shows a demonstration of the complete game
